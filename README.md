Developed a Python-based web scraping application using BeautifulSoup and Selenium to automate the extraction of structured data from dynamic websites. The scraped data was cleaned, processed, and stored in AWS DynamoDB to enable efficient retrieval and integration with downstream analytics workflows. This solution helped streamline data collection and supported data-driven decision-making in real-time.
